The mornings by the channel bring a sense of calm and anticipation while the evenings under the simmering yellow streetlights intoxicate those who dare to indulge.

The epicentre of fun in Northwestern Europe. It makes for a picturesque entry into this popular tourist destination.

It is much evident in Amsterdam’s canal life, the boat houses, the countless bridges and of course the bicycles. The city has around 165 canals forming half a circle around the city. I fancied a stroll in one of the boats but decided against it. I needed the walk. I needed to take in some scenery and it’s vibe that this place is famous for around the world. If boating in the canal is an immersive experience, the walk around the canals and by the bridges is an intrusive experience into the life of a local.

I wanted to unwind, needed to unwind, I found just the right spot to escape.\nThere are weeks that flow by without even an ounce of self-realization. Weeks that keep you busy with an endless stream of work, work calls and deadlines. The mind \u0026 body crave an escape. Travel and photography are my escape from hyper-reality. The lens XF18-55mm was on its first outing and in an ideal place too. The beautiful scenery of people pedalling along in high spirits across the narrow roads and bridges. Most of them always with a tinge of smiles on their faces. It brought a smile to me too. The escape was well and truly afoot. The summer breeze was guiding me with good intentions. The stroll by the canal got me past some locals enjoying their evening feast. A feast well matched with a cloud of cigarette smoke and light surf rock music playing from tiny Bluetooth speakers. As I continued to stroll, there were neighbours enjoying glasses of wine and strumming the guitar sitting right outside their building and by the canal, their feet hung from the edge. The whole scene felt like a Wes Anderson movie. I decided to walk from one canal bridge to another and circle back. The view brought me back. Sunset kept me there. Finally, when the sun decided to call it a day and painted the whole scene orange, my camera obliged. My mind was at ease, I got lost in the lens and the landscape. The mood was set and it was time to bask in the glory of an evening by the Amsterdam Canals. The beer tasted better.\nIf there was ever a moment to be happy and content, it might as well be in a joyous moment of self-reflection. The beautiful city of Amsterdam has traditional and modern cultures perfectly amalgamating into a self-aware lifestyle. As for me, the exploration had just begun, of the city and my own with a trusted company always by my side, capturing all the memories.\n","wordCount":"618","inLanguage":"en","image":"http://localhost:1313/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"2025-07-27T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2025-07-27T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Me"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://localhost:1313/photography/amsterdam---the-city-of-canals/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Vaibhav Kalekar","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://localhost:1313/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script><script defer src=https://cloud.umami.is/script.js data-website-id=7e42b104-79f9-438a-90ab-917bb500739a></script><script defer src=https://cloud.umami.is/script.js data-website-id=7e42b104-79f9-438a-90ab-917bb500739a></script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=http://localhost:1313/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=http://localhost:1313/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
