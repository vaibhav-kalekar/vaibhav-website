[{"content":"I was living in Mumbai travelling on the local train trying to make it to my lectures on time, my cellphone, the ever dependable and unbreakable Nokia 3310 kept me in check. I was in contact with my friends, I was entertained with the limited selection of games and in the later models I had good selection of radio. I had multiple iterations of the Symbian phone until NgageQD which allowed me to game, watch videos and listen to music in a convenient way. All these activities were part of my day to day life which was spent in splendid company of friends exploring the real world.\nHow did we get in this precarious scenario of preferring Technology over human contact? The answer to this lies in the advent of social media and targeted advertisement that allowed Big Tech companies to make unprecedented amount of money by exploiting the very users they pretended to care for and built their products around. As soon as the companies realized that the longer the world spent its time on the internet, the more it is to learn and exploit them for revenue. The influx of revenue brought in the concept of growth mindset. How can we have more of this revenue and quickly? The answer was always there and we kept presenting them with more opportunities for them to exploit our attention. It was only natural for the brilliant minds of the Silicon Valley figure out that the greatest innovation is not in building great products but in building products that keep the great minds engaged indefinitely. Thus, the inventively designed phones of the past like Sony Walkman, Motorola Razr, Nokia NGage gave way to some of the glass bricks we see today. A self reflective piece of glass that shows the entire world in a nice OLED screen, all the while losing the essence of the human who is using it. The irony is, I keep going back to the old days where my usage was and to great extent is limited to reminders, texts, calls and music.\nWhy am I raising such questions and bringing the nostalgia into this post? The new wave of innovative smartphone designs, the return of the early 2000s fashion and my rekindled love for the Nu-Metal, Alternative \u0026amp; Pop Rock is making me rethink my relationship with Technology again. Being from the lucky generation that actually remembers the time spent with limited technology to the present times that are drowning in the sea of information, I actually have the option to choose the kind of technology that aligns with me. The latest generation Z is left with no choice but to manage with the information overload and a life overrun by technology. It feels like we are coming a full circle with the technology. If we ignore the mess that is the half baked LLM loosely threatening to take over our lives, there seems to be healthy competition brewing in the Tech world when it comes to new hardware. It is promising to take us back to the time where devices were unique, user preference actually mattered and customization was not just for nerds and geeks but part of everyday life and everyday use of technology. For e.g. The new smartphones built by companies like Nothing, OnePlus, Xiaomi, Huawei and even Samsung raise intrigue and give users the choice to get devices that may feel their own. The computers are fun again, likes of Asus, Razer, Framework, System76 and others are making some brilliant products that make users want to try their hands on new hardware and tweak it. It feels like there is a movement brewing to make tech fun again and the usual big boys of tech have decent competition for the first time in decade. This movement seems to be taking me back to the old days of building PC and PC gaming, all the while tinkering with the devices I use so it feels unique to me. It is safe to say, what is old is new again and I welcome it with open arms.\nWhere will the Future take us? If I am imagining things the right way, the path to the future is exactly where we left the past. The ideal path to get to the future we all deserve will be to go back to the fork in the road in the past where we took the wrong turn towards the present. Rekindling my tryst with the individuality that allowed me to explore the tech scene when I was growing up, peaked my interest and allowed me to dive deep into the world of software engineering, I feel like I am tugging along the string that I let go in the past. After 15 years in the software industry, I felt there was nothing interesting to do anymore and was looking to pivot to the newly formed roles that delve into Product Marketing or Developer Relations. As I dug deeper into the rabbit hole of evolving tech and its origin, the more I found myself going back to the roots and that is where I feel I can restart again with added sense of enthusiasm and blend it with emerging technologies. May be and just may be I will give AI a twirl, I know the younger me would definitely be curious to know how well I can use AI to make stuff for myself. Technology is beautiful when it allows the individuals to innovate and express their true selves rather than letting them drown in the ever increasing pressures of growth for growth sake.\nThe future is bright if it is built on values of the glorious times we all seemed to have forgotten. Here\u0026rsquo;s hoping we take back the charge.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/the-perfect-future-was-in-the-past/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI was living in Mumbai travelling on the local train trying to make it to my lectures on time, my cellphone, the ever dependable and unbreakable Nokia 3310 kept me in check.

The times are highly complicated and the people dealing with the complications seem to be well versed with heightening the complication rather than dissolving it. But I don\u0026rsquo;t want to talk about the world problems. I am no one to solve them. I am just a techie trying not to get replaced by AI agents or robots or whoever else whats to take my job from me. I will probably end up working on the team that creates those very AI agents that will do my job, so there is a sense of nobility of working hard in there somewhere.\nThe optimism in the pessimistic times It is a hot summer morning here in Mumbai. I am spending my summer here at home in Mumbai after a long time. Also in a very long time, I am working on building something I am really passionate about, so it is quite a remarkable time for me. I am excited but also somewhat shocked reading about the events of the world. I start my day reading about the world leaders and their associates screaming with their actions and talking thoughtlessly. The coffee never tasted more bitter, and its my fault for starting my day this way. Anyways I quickly move on, to an ideal day where I begin working on my startup, jotting down ideas, writing about my thoughts and learnings and getting excited about the direction of the present and the expectation of the future. The music from 80s and 90s is blasting in my ear, everything seems so hopeful. Back to reality, there is a war going on, the world\u0026rsquo;s biggest economy is shooting itself in the foot and there are no subtle diplomatic thought leaders whispering sense into this world anywhere. On top of it, the blatant and ignorant propaganda that we all have been sucked into sounds too ridiculous but its their truth and may be ours, if we really want it. Probably the word I am looking for is some kind of \u0026rsquo;nuance\u0026rsquo; is lost in this world.\nMy world is filled with Intricate Technology Alright, I am not saying I have answers to all the problems I am faced with in my day to day life. I am sure anyone who is reading this hasn\u0026rsquo;t got everything figured out as well. But imagine we start blatantly telling each other fictional tales of hopeful world and taking no action to actually solve the problems bothering us. It would be bonkers to believe that we have all our wits together. But here we are! Its lunch time here in my day. The heat is getting to me ever so slightly. The food intake suffers but then the coffee supplements my chaotic day enough to keep me going through the day. I get back to work through the last stretch before I call it a day. I like to read and work on something new that happens in my world of technology. I am excited to begin working on AI Agents, try out some libraries, commercial LLMs and figure out some personal use case to implement all of it. I am researching for it and soon enough I ran into articles where the excitement faded into existential crisis. All the CEOs have on thing in common, apart from being rich, is that they like to just throw around predictions that sound absurd to general public. It makes them look visionary. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter if it actually realizes to be true. The statement is out, the press is pressed, the reader is panicked. Probably the word I am looking for is some kind of \u0026rsquo;nuance\u0026rsquo; that is lost in the tech world.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s call it a day shall we? I don\u0026rsquo;t mean to sound rude and bash the visionaries of the world. Not that they are reading this post. I believe I don\u0026rsquo;t emote in binary so I would say although I can see a world drastically different in the future, the present is a mix of hope \u0026amp; pessimism. Did that make sense? Probably not, but then the answer is somewhere in between. I am just about to end my day in the hot summer Mumbai night with some cold Ice Cream so I am chilled about the whole situation by now. I relax into my bed thinking the world will have some new crisis tomorrow morning and I am sure everyone associated with it will throw around headlines that will give us existential threat. Why worry eh! The world we live in is so devoid of Nuance, it is gaslighting each other.

All the knowledge I have about geopolitical trade is from the news, Thanks to Trump\u0026rsquo;s insistence on stirring the trading pot with vigor. What have I learnt so far? Tariffs are good. They will save the economy and will bring down inflation and will launch the world into spending frenzy and deepen the nationalist sentiment. A popular source of my information is a platform called X or formerly known as Twitter. The owner of the platform is apparently a genius and the most powerful figure of the free world leans on him for advice. Surely I should have no qualms in believing anything that comes from these sources, right? In a sane world run by logical and honest people, we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t even have such questions in first place. As I am realizing the harsh truth that the present world is anything but sane and logical. What is a common man like me who relies on logic and sanity supposed to do in these times? The answer might not be that straightforward, if there is one.\nThe reason for this long winded rambling about the current state of chaotic information is my sheer confusion of state of affairs and utter bewilderment at the ease with which the incompetence, corruption and misinformation in the media is normalized in the world. My day starts with a scrambled mess of overpriced eggs with a loaf of bread and generic blend of coffee bought at wholesale with a tune of the latest madness around the impact of tariffs imposed by two countries with a promise of some X Billions to be added to the economy. My eggs are dry, coffee cold and the loaf of bread a hardened mess by the time I figure out the ways these geopolitical trade policies will effect me. If it is not the constant robotic feed of the social media frying my brains, there is some new Large Language Model claiming to do my job better than me. It took me 15 years to be confident about my proficiency in the job, but then an LLM can do that in 15 minutes now, on a slow day, with its one hand tied behind its back.\nThe sheer arrogance of all these events is baffling to me. The people who seem to have lost the grasp of reality are taking decisions for me and the rest of the world on our way of living and earning. All the while patting our backs in a condescending way so as as to suggest that we are in control and voted for it in all our sanity.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t have any answers to these ramblings, I think you must have guessed it by now but my reason for this post is to encourage us all keep raising questions while the madness unfolds in front of us. I am vetting my information sources while constantly questioning the motives of the decisions being taken by the world leaders. Probably there is a light at the end of this metaphorical tunnel, albeit in a deer in a headlight kind of situation.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/tariffs-inflation--ai---why-the-world-feels-more-chaotic-than-ever/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am not an Economist.

The effect of this accelerated growth of technology on our environment and world is the hot topic of discussion. May be more relevant topic will be to discuss the changes we will have to make to our lives due to advancements in AI.\nAren\u0026rsquo;t we all annoyed at the constant jab of being replaceable by AI towards the artists, developers and other semi-essential class of workers who work hard to make a living? AI seems to be specifically aimed at replacing a very targeted group of working class folks. I for once am thrilled at all the art that AI is creating trained at the expense of the art of current artists, struggling to make a living. Replacing the customer service agent who interacts with the frustrated customers for the issues in the product that may as well be introduced by the use of AI by the development team to build the new features. The new line of iphones or horde of android phones boasting AI features that no consumer demanded yet it is shoved down the digital throats of the users. It\u0026rsquo;s as if the Tech giants decided that AI is the new frontier and we all have to accept it and adopt it at the expense of our lifestyles. My question is simple - Do we have to drastically change our life for AI or can it meet us halfway?\nProbably, there is a better use case somewhere out there in the world for AI to make our lives better, our existing life without having to change every facet of it. Are the AI makers going to take that route? Definitely, no. If we have learned anything at all from the big internet boom of early 2000s is that the big tech corporations will always find a way to exploit the average population at the expense of their physical and mental health to a point where an entire generation is dependent on the big tech software for trivial decision making of their non-trivial lives. May be, the idea to write this article was also influenced by an ad I saw on Instagram which was fed to me as a result of my internet activity on my phone and other apps like X. Do you recognize this seed of doubt in your own ideas and work? This is what the new age combination of AI and Internet manages to do to our thinking.\nI know, all this seems like a very long winded way of saying AI is bad, big tech is bad, should we go live in the woods? Let me assure you it is more than that. I have been working in the tech industry for 15 years. I have seen most of it, the way it evolves, worked on solutions and then seen them become invalid in the tests of time. There is only one thing that matters and it has always been the case, Evolution. The age old answer to our existence. The evolution of us as beings from being barbaric survivalists to sophisticated innovators and explorers of space, its all a result of being independent and free thinkers with an ability to acquire and master real world skills. AI in its current form can barely scratch the earth\u0026rsquo;s surface to uncover resources required to help us make a living. But if you have followed the big tech news, you would think AI is at forefront of everything and we might as well pack up and go back to living in the woods.\nI am not just criticizing like an average internal rambler for the sake of it. I want to present with solutions or at least try to understand a way to share a common ground as a veteran tech enthusiast between old tech and new age AI tech world. I appreciate the use of LLM in my day to day work. As a Data Engineer \u0026amp; Analyst running a consultancy, having a LLM on my machine is like having a sparring partner for everyday work. Am I going to replace a team of Data Engineers with bunch of AI Agents, short answer no. I might encourage running the solutions through the models for any issues before deploying it on production. For my hobbies and passions, I am a classic rock kind of guy so I don\u0026rsquo;t even appreciate the auto-tuned mess that is modern music, so I will never replace my Led Zeppelin and classic rock collection with slop made by AI. Similarly, there is no replacement for a thought fully created masterpiece like Lord of the rings, the book and the movie, that makes original thought and writing of a visionary more accessible to a avid movie goer and a reader. I might use AI to make some marketing content for my consultancy business but then I am not going to pretend that the movies made by AI are in same realm as the average movie made by artists.\nI think we are all looking for some perspective and expectation management in our day to day lives when it comes to using technology. I don\u0026rsquo;t want AI to summarize my emails and texts to me or constantly try to guess my words I am texting or suggest places to visit or eat out. If I have learnt anything from the scandals of data mining from tech companies is that they want to tap into the thoughts and minds of people just to drown the masses in consumerism. We have wholeheartedly allowed them to do so, at the expense of our individualism or the very essence that makes us humans. I am a tech enthusiast and I want to co-exist with the technology and not constantly have it replace all my interests and hobbies, dare I say my friends \u0026amp; life. I am curious to explore more of AI and new tech and see how the balance is maintained between consumer and creator.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai--humans---how-do-we-co-exist/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThe world is rapidly moving towards an automated \u0026amp; robotic future.
