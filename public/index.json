I am trying to understand the Aussie way of living while holding onto the quiet traumas of spending three years in Germany. It is all an overload of emotion while managing two states of life. Sydney is a beautiful city. The induction into a new country and a busy city like Sydney has been seamless, a lot of it thanks to my partner and some of it thanks to the system. On a personal level, I tend to find my solace in simple things that are familiar to me, my system, and my writing. Here I am, while I wait for the new chapter to begin in full swing, exploring the familiar world of Technology and sharing my experience with you all in writing.\nBroken Framework revived with Arch \u0026amp; Omarchy I run a small Data Consultancy firm for startups and small businesses to make sense of their Data Strategy \u0026amp; Architecture. You can read more about it here - Etherion Consulting. Being a Data Engineer \u0026amp; Architect, I preferred to get a Linux-based laptop called Framework 13 with AMD Ryzen 7 and loaded it with Ubuntu for daily work. Everything worked fine until I had to travel with it, and in the process, the motherboard died on me. Looking to set up a business and having no way to quickly fix the issue at hand, I decided to go back to my trusted MacBook Pro. Fast Forward, now in Sydney, having revived the Framework laptop and installed Arch Linux, I came across the growing sensation on the internet called Omarchy. I had to wget it. I was not ready for the pleasant surprise that would come with it.\nMacOS is Amazing, Linux is Personal A little bit of context behind this tug of war between macOS and Linux. I have been a happy Windows user throughout the early days of my career, while lately I have enjoyed using macOS for work and personal use. The MacBooks are wonderful devices with very little to complain about, other than the cost of these wonderful machines. So imagine my surprise when I had the chance to buy a new device for my business, MacBooks weren\u0026rsquo;t the obvious choice I had leaned towards for purchase. I went back to the old school way of making a purchasing decision, researching to my heart\u0026rsquo;s content and narrowing the options that agreed with my preferences. It\u0026rsquo;s crazy, I know, why not just get the latest and greatest, right? I had made my choice, and after much back and forth with my girlfriend, I leaped.\nBringing back the enthusiasm for Technology It is time-consuming to sift through hordes of processors and chip combinations to find with best performance and battery combinations to finally narrow down an aesthetically pleasing device that I would like to pick up for use every day. It is also satisfying to know that the device in hand is something I chose piece by piece to my liking. A connection I tend to lack with the ready-to-use MacBooks, Surface, and other Windows devices. As someone who started their career in the early 2000s, I enjoyed the process of building PCs and researching new devices, which was lost over time. Now, at a stage where I can afford to make purchases without researching the devices, I have lost the enthusiasm for them. Building the Framework Laptop and loading Linux with something like Omarchy gave me the feeling of owning a personal computer as really personal.\nTug of War and the Winners Anyone who has been in the world of Software or Hardware knows that there is always something newer and shinier that catches our eyes. Thus, it is never a choice made for the long term, but a choice resonating from an ethos. Am I a MacBook or a Linux guy? Do I like to build stuff or own shiny things? Do I enjoy my work, or do I only care about the growth and revenue? As a business owner looking to build data engineering solutions for clients, I need to pick a lane. You know what, I might be on the cusp of going full throttle with one such lane.\nThe Analog Perspective - Please Join!

The world around him is chaotic, yet hardworking and honest. People on the chain get busy early in the morning to catch the worm, so to speak. The jobs range from trivial to extremely sensitive depending on the time of the day. Every small job matters on the chain, as it is a matter of livelihood for some and pride for others.\nEon woke up in a furor over the events that transpired yesterday. Up until now he has gone way out of his way to make sure he is living in a incognito mode. He didn\u0026rsquo;t appreciate being dragged into the whole ruckus surrounding the kid. There are scars from the past and memories that still haunt Eon and he had no inclination to reopen them for anybody\u0026rsquo;s sake. One look at the condition of the boy might change his mind, it is exactly what he was trying to avoid.\nThe past and the future with unpleasant present Xer woke up from his slumber with Eon staring at a device in his hands. He is not new to the running around and evading goons or law enforcement professionals but this is something entirely out of his range of skillset. All Xer wanted to do was find something to trade in the thrift store for his comfort, probably for a day or two. Xer looked at Eon and he knew something was not right and in all the serious expressions on his face, Xer realized that something was about to go very wrong. He looked around the place they were holed up in.\nThe light seeped through a small window that felt more like a skylight. The entire layout felt more like a container or a blob floating on something or held together by strings. A hatch that opened outwards while the entire room was barely enough for two people to stretch. It seemed to be designed with specific purpose in mind, and with the look on the face of Eon it was serving its purpose, may be not for long. The container seemed to be made up of materials that might be used to make submarine. The space between hard shell and Xer was separated by sort of foam that provided comfort. You can barely stand and the hexagonal shape made no excuse to have a corner in the container. There were supplies may be for a week if you don\u0026rsquo;t plan to eat much while you are there. A system that was offline and the entire place seem to block any kind of wireless communication trying to connect with the device. Only source of connection was a small port that was connected to some network on the outside. Xer tried to peep through the window but all he could see was the morning sky and some wires dangling between him and the sky, probably holding the container together in place where he is currently seated.\nEon repeated the question he had asked in his apartment the day before - \u0026ldquo;Where did you get this device and Why are you carrying with you?\u0026rdquo;\nXer didn\u0026rsquo;t break his gaze away from the window. He wanted to ignore Eon and concentrate on not panicking while in this confined space. He never did well under duress and more so in such a confined space. He tapped on the window again.\nEon seemed irritated and threw a protein bar at Xer in a way to get his attention. He partially succeeded in irritating Xer but not exactly grabbing his attention. Eon tried again.\n\u0026ldquo;The device you hold is important but dangerous, it has comprised not just you but dragged me in with you as well. It cannot be destroyed and once the authorities got to know that it is out there somewhere, they will do anything to get it back. So I ask again, Why and How did you get it? Do you know what it is?\u0026rdquo;\nXer was intrigued. \u0026ldquo;Is it worth a lot?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Its worth more than you and me for those who seek it, and they will have no qualms in killing us for it. So for fuck sake , answer my question.\u0026rdquo; Eon\u0026rsquo;s hoarse voice echoed.\n\u0026ldquo;I found this in the landfill, I told you before. I did not know what it is but I know it looked special. The men at the thrift store were interested but then they tried to force it from me. That is all. Now tell me what it is? and give it back to me, its mine.\u0026rdquo; Xer tried to get some authority back.\nEon looked at him for a while, looked at the device connected to his mini system like a tablet or a laptop, stared at the screen in front of him for a while, so as to seem like he was stuck in a conundrum in his mind. It was few minutes before he spoke with a decisive tone.\n\u0026ldquo;The device is from the year 2025. It was launched by the administration as a way to distribute new form of currency, a token if you will for those who worked for the administration and carried out specific functions. The device was means to collect compensation or salary and use it to spend it on essentials. It was considered a previliged way to hold the currency and only worked within administration approved regions. It was discontinued when the device was used to illegally distribute the token which the administration had no way to control. It was replaced by another device and then another until today where the entire ecosystem of tokens or currency is attached to a individual\u0026rsquo;s identity scanned with biometrics only.\u0026rdquo; Eon explained it generously and continued.\n\u0026ldquo;What you found is a device which has tokens still active yet it is not tracked by the system in any way until I plugged it into the network with my system. It exposed the device, my system, me and my associated you as well. Hence the authorities on our tail and probably we will end of dead if we don\u0026rsquo;t figure out a way to deal with it in a more effective way.\u0026rdquo;\nXer liked the explanation of the device as it meant it is of tremendous value and a big pay day to make him comfortable for near future. He was no stranger to some jeopardy and was brought up on the chain by parents who struggled enough for him to learn to carry his own weight as soon as he was able to run around.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/fiction/the-archivist-on-the-chain---episode-2/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"episode-2\"\u003eEpisode 2\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mornings are never pleasant for Eon.

The mornings are busy, full of the chaotic hustle of people looking to get ahead of the day. The concept of time for everyone on the chain is relative to the comfort of the day. Some days are long, full of work, and those are good days, while some days are short, spent mining through the landfill of junk that might be of some value to someone. On days like these that the people of the chain wonder whether time could go back and they would change their decision to remain on the chain.\nThough Life does not come with a rewind button, no matter how much we try to make it happen.\nThe layers and layers of landfill full of electronic and technological waste were surrounded by ten-storey housing projects that once belonged to the working class. The project has seen better days. The entrances were boarded off, only for the people to carve an entrance into them. Once inside, there was no direction for any specific apartment, and it was a miracle that the people were able to make it up and down the stairs. A perfect metaphor of the times when the once-thriving working-class community lay in ruins only for the people to turn it into a home, as much as they can.\nEon lived on the top floor and had been a permanent resident of the projects since his birth. Never ventured out to the far lands to even witness the destruction of the world as he knew beyond the chain. He had no interest in intruding on the other side, where the people pretended nothing ever happened.\n\u0026ldquo;The suffering only goes away with the sufferer, and I intend to see it through to the end.\u0026rdquo;\nEon, 58 years old now, has lived most of his life as a minter on the chain, looking to improve the lives of the people by giving them something to trade with the other world. A wise man, now, at least that is how the residents of the chain referred to him, he was neither the messiah nor the villain, but the only one who experienced the world as it was before and what it is now. Being in such a privileged position meant he always had a curious set of people asking him questions about the other world and about the good times of the chain when it was thriving. Eon hated answering these questions and preferred his solitude. He is at an age where he is allowed to be grumpy and act it out.\nThe Break in the Routine Eon barely slept. Even if he did, the nightmares would not let him have a peaceful night. The diet of whatever is available on the day from the project canteen is not helpful to maintain any sort of healthy routine. It is enough to get by, for the day, a week, or whatever comes next. He rarely complained.\nIt was mid-afternoon when he heard a commotion in the building passage way, loud enough to disturb his afternoon zone of work. He prefers not to engage in the daily curfuffle of the miscreants. It was his policy not to engage until one of his set rules was broken, then he had to set things right.\nOne of the rules was simple - Do Not Bother Me and My Work.\n\u0026ldquo;Do not force us to take everything from you, boy. We are warning you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Useless Tah, Cant … Catch…A… Bloody…Kid.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Stop Preaching and Trip Him, Will you?\u0026rdquo;\nThe noise and the commentary were too much for Eon, who by now wanted to get his peace back. It was not a regular occurrence. He chose to live in this wing of the building in the projects for the very reason that it looked almost abandoned. Probably he was wrong, as he has been about so many things in his life.\n\u0026ldquo;Fuck, Axon, What is taking so long?\u0026rdquo; Spoke one of the miscreants. He seemed like the one in charge of the operation being carried out outside.\n\u0026ldquo;He\u0026rsquo;s a slippery bastard, Ax,\u0026rdquo; responded Tah.\nEon opened the apartment door to get a peek into the operation and was immediately pushed aside violently by a four-foot figure who was rushing to find solace away from the passage of the building. Eon gasped and grunted in an irritated tone.\n\u0026ldquo;Get the Fuck off my doors. Leave me Alone … Get out!\u0026rdquo;\nThe miscreants who were chasing behind the kid almost ran into Eon, but held themselves off at the last moment. He got hold of the one who was closest and grunted in a hoarse voice to leave him alone in peace. They all nodded in unison and rushed out of the building. Eon slammed the door behind them.\nThe peace was back in the realm for him, but then there was a new problem. He had an unwanted guest in the apartment, whom he would rather get rid of as soon as he possibly can, for his liking.\nAll That is Found, Should not be Deciphered \u0026ldquo;You have five minutes to get out of here before I lose my mind and throw you out of the window.\u0026rdquo; Eon was as blunt as he could be in his instructions. He always liked to maintain it in his communications. He left no room for confusion. To his annoyance, though, there was no response. He repeated the instructions in his truest feelings, but still no response.\nEon slowly started to move around his apartment towards the bedroom to see if the kid was listening or if something had happened to him. As he approached the bedroom door, he saw a figure short enough to hide between the shelf and the window curtains. He looked scared and feisty, yet helpless and desperately in need of guidance.\n\u0026ldquo;Who are you? What are you doing here? Last chance to answer.\u0026rdquo; Eon checked with the kid introspectively.\nGetting no response from the other end, He moved towards the window, slowly at first, not to cause any more commotion, but then took a big step to grab hold of the kid.\nEon\u0026rsquo;s large hands and strong grip got hold of the kid, who immediately winced at the contact and hissed in defiance of the unwarranted roughness. Eon was too strong for him and managed to get hold of him and picked him up by his arms to further assert his authority. The kid tried to scream, but nothing came out, and he flailed his feet to kick Eon, but failed at it. He soon realized the helplessness of the situation and tried to reassess it. He looked straight into Eon\u0026rsquo;s eyes.\nIt has been quite a while since Eon had any kind of sustained interaction with anyone. He preferred to keep himself busy with work and strayed away from human interaction or even the idea of it. This was deeply unsettling to him. He hadn\u0026rsquo;t looked into the eyes of another human in years, especially not in such a closed encounter. An alien feeling paralyzed him.\n\u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s your name?\u0026rdquo; Eon asked in a calm tone.\n\u0026ldquo;Xer,\u0026rdquo; the kid replied in a scared yet inquisitive manner.\n\u0026ldquo;Why are the miscreants chasing you?\u0026rdquo;\nXer thought for a minute, continued to look at Eon\u0026rsquo;s eyes, and answered calmly.\n\u0026ldquo;Found something in the Landfill, all mine, it\u0026rsquo;s alien, like me. I kill them, and take it back.\u0026rdquo;\nEon put the kid back on the floor, held him by the shoulder, and led him back into the kitchen area, sat him down at the coffee table. He politely asked the kid to show him the thing that he had found in the landfill. Xer declined. Eon insisted, and Xer could see that in his widened red eyes, closed fist, and a slight lean towards him. Xer was not the one to back out, but he assessed that he was at a disadvantage here. He took a wrong turn, into the apartment of this angry, grumpy old man, and now he might lose the alien object he curiously admired so much for the last three hours while being chased by the miscreants.\nXer was reluctant, yet he took the object out of his inner jacket pocket and placed it on the table.\nEon had one look at it and immediately recognized it. He thought all these devices were destroyed years ago and were largely useless in today\u0026rsquo;s world. He picked it up and pressed the small button on it recklessly. The device beeped.\nArtefacts: Connect the Old and the New World Eon was taken aback. He pushed Xer with a barrage of questions on the whereabouts of this device. Finding something in the landfill meant there was nothing to trace it back, no guarantee it was valuable or trash, and no accountability for ownership. To think of it, it is exactly the place such devices are found.\nIt was almost two decades ago, Eon worked at one of the firms where they exclusively minted tokens for the big corporations. The tokens are the cryptographic currency that can be exchanged for a real currency of the time. As time went by, the old and the new world changed the way they looked at money. Every organization wanted to bring their token to the negotiation table against other organizations in trade. The fiat currency was the global standard, but the valuation of such currency depends on the global order comprising of few powerful entities controlling the supply and demand.\nThe minters were responsible for managing the tokens for their organization and coordinating with the traders to keep enough of them in supply to make them hold their value. The bigger the organization, the higher the circulation and the value of the token, which meant it was easy to move the money around against different tokens and fiat currencies. The big corporations always got their way.\nThe miners held a small device that allowed them to connect to exchange terminals to trade the tokens with their unique private keys. Only those with the device could trade on the exchange terminals, while the general population was given wallets to strictly store their tokens for expenditure. A system that worked efficiently to keep the divide wider for those who controlled the tokens and those who were dependent on them. A cornerstone of the collapse of any society. Power concentrated in the hands of few that abused it to no end.\nEon worked at this corporation long enough to understand the way they manipulated the market and indulged in illegal activities. He made sure enough of the tokens were minted for his use, filled his wallets, and vanished from the corporation never to be discovered by them again.\nThe device on the table that Xer discovered in the landfill was one of those used by Minters to connect to exchange terminals. As the global power shifted, these devices became rare and were only held by those in power. It was extremely rare to find one discarded in a landfill. They were discreetly disposed of to not to fall into the wrong hands. The wrong hands of someone like Eon.\nEon inserted the device into one of the computers at his place, which could connect to the exchange. He expected nothing but an error to be displayed on the screen, or worse, the device to be unrecognizable. To Eon\u0026rsquo;s astonishment, the device started beeping as soon as it was connected to the terminal. It could mean only one thing: the device was immediately recognized by the terminal. Eon thought to himself that the worst that could happen is they disable the device remotely as it is connected to the exchange, and this matter will end here and now. There was loud beeping on the computer and his other handheld device. It was strange to hear this beeping after so many years, but he had a faint recollection after hearing that horrible noise. He looked at Xer and then looked at the terminal, at the handheld screen, and read the message that accompanied it. \u0026ldquo;Security Alert! Please return the device to the exchange.\u0026rdquo;\nThis was not the kind of message that should have appeared for a device rotting in a landfill. Certainly not the message he wanted to see on a quiet afternoon.\nHe grabbed the backpack, put the handheld device, some of his belongings, and some eatables into the backpack, glanced at Xer, and signalled him to follow as he climbed out of his top-floor apartment window. He knew the peaceful life he was living up until now might be over for a while.\nXer, in his confusion, understood one thing clearly: when it was time to run, it was his time to shine.\nAs both Eon and Xer jumped off the apartment window onto the fire escape, the footsteps from the passage became louder, followed by a distinct thud on Eon\u0026rsquo;s apartment door.\nEon, while climbing the fire escape, thought to himself, \u0026ldquo;They are still sharp as a tack, Impressive.\u0026rdquo;\nTo be Continued!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/fiction/the-archivist-on-the-chain/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThe loud screeching sound of the metal scratching against each other is unnerving, like peeling off a piece of dry skin from the body, only to discover the horror that it\u0026rsquo;s gone too far.

I know there are a lot of cities and towns with unique quirks about them, but none that I came across like Barcelona, with the big city vibe masked by a feel of a small town with rich cultural heritage and tradition. From the Gothic Quarter in the city center of Barcelona to Park Güell and the Picasso Museum, the city celebrates history. Ask the street musician playing Harp, he might have some verses.\nWalk down the Gothic quarters to the old town, and the sights of street musicians change to those of small-time art galleries.

It is a tradition in Catalonia.\nA little way down the road, the evenings in Barcelona go well into the midnight. The sunset hue is mesmerising. Enjoy it with a bit of coffee and croquettes, but leave enough room for a drink and olive oil-infused dinners.\nGet ready to walk a lot. I mean a lot. Ever wondered if you could experience a zoomed-in view of one of the wonders of the world? On my way from Park Güell, I got a zoomed-out view of the beautiful Basílica de la Sagrada Família. It was in that moment, I decided to have a look at the inside, and I was not disappointed. The spiritual experience is not in the belief but in the moment of emotional revelation.\nThe interiors of the Basílica de la Sagrada Família are a spiritual experience of their own. The reflection of sunrays from the colorful glass panes of the interior columns of the church cut right through any preoccupied thoughts in the mind. It immediately transported me to some deep reflections and made me forget my immediate surroundings. Gaudí seemed obsessed with Gothic architecture, and it surely reflected in all his works. Even the supposedly unfinished Basilica. I made sure the experience at the Basilica was the last one for the day, giving myself enough time to reflect on its marvel throughout the evening.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/photography/barcelona---the-beautiful-coastal-city-in-catalonia/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eToday, I am revisiting one of the most beautiful European places I have ever visited.

I was in contact with my friends, I was entertained with the limited selection of games and in the later models I had good selection of radio. I had multiple iterations of the Symbian phone until NgageQD which allowed me to game, watch videos and listen to music in a convenient way. All these activities were part of my day to day life which was spent in splendid company of friends exploring the real world.\nHow did we get in this precarious scenario of preferring Technology over human contact? The answer to this lies in the advent of social media and targeted advertisement that allowed Big Tech companies to make unprecedented amount of money by exploiting the very users they pretended to care for and built their products around. As soon as the companies realized that the longer the world spent its time on the internet, the more it is to learn and exploit them for revenue. The influx of revenue brought in the concept of growth mindset. How can we have more of this revenue and quickly? The answer was always there and we kept presenting them with more opportunities for them to exploit our attention. It was only natural for the brilliant minds of the Silicon Valley figure out that the greatest innovation is not in building great products but in building products that keep the great minds engaged indefinitely. Thus, the inventively designed phones of the past like Sony Walkman, Motorola Razr, Nokia NGage gave way to some of the glass bricks we see today. A self reflective piece of glass that shows the entire world in a nice OLED screen, all the while losing the essence of the human who is using it. The irony is, I keep going back to the old days where my usage was and to great extent is limited to reminders, texts, calls and music.\nWhy am I raising such questions and bringing the nostalgia into this post? The new wave of innovative smartphone designs, the return of the early 2000s fashion and my rekindled love for the Nu-Metal, Alternative \u0026amp; Pop Rock is making me rethink my relationship with Technology again. Being from the lucky generation that actually remembers the time spent with limited technology to the present times that are drowning in the sea of information, I actually have the option to choose the kind of technology that aligns with me. The latest generation Z is left with no choice but to manage with the information overload and a life overrun by technology. It feels like we are coming a full circle with the technology. If we ignore the mess that is the half baked LLM loosely threatening to take over our lives, there seems to be healthy competition brewing in the Tech world when it comes to new hardware. It is promising to take us back to the time where devices were unique, user preference actually mattered and customization was not just for nerds and geeks but part of everyday life and everyday use of technology. For e.g. The new smartphones built by companies like Nothing, OnePlus, Xiaomi, Huawei and even Samsung raise intrigue and give users the choice to get devices that may feel their own. The computers are fun again, likes of Asus, Razer, Framework, System76 and others are making some brilliant products that make users want to try their hands on new hardware and tweak it. It feels like there is a movement brewing to make tech fun again and the usual big boys of tech have decent competition for the first time in decade. This movement seems to be taking me back to the old days of building PC and PC gaming, all the while tinkering with the devices I use so it feels unique to me. It is safe to say, what is old is new again and I welcome it with open arms.\nWhere will the Future take us? If I am imagining things the right way, the path to the future is exactly where we left the past. The ideal path to get to the future we all deserve will be to go back to the fork in the road in the past where we took the wrong turn towards the present. Rekindling my tryst with the individuality that allowed me to explore the tech scene when I was growing up, peaked my interest and allowed me to dive deep into the world of software engineering, I feel like I am tugging along the string that I let go in the past. After 15 years in the software industry, I felt there was nothing interesting to do anymore and was looking to pivot to the newly formed roles that delve into Product Marketing or Developer Relations. As I dug deeper into the rabbit hole of evolving tech and its origin, the more I found myself going back to the roots and that is where I feel I can restart again with added sense of enthusiasm and blend it with emerging technologies. May be and just may be I will give AI a twirl, I know the younger me would definitely be curious to know how well I can use AI to make stuff for myself. Technology is beautiful when it allows the individuals to innovate and express their true selves rather than letting them drown in the ever increasing pressures of growth for growth sake.\nThe future is bright if it is built on values of the glorious times we all seemed to have forgotten. Here\u0026rsquo;s hoping we take back the charge.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/tech/the-perfect-future-was-in-the-past/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI was living in Mumbai travelling on the local train trying to make it to my lectures on time, my cellphone, the ever dependable and unbreakable Nokia 3310 kept me in check.

I am spending my summer here at home in Mumbai after a long time. Also in a very long time, I am working on building something I am really passionate about, so it is quite a remarkable time for me. I am excited but also somewhat shocked reading about the events of the world. I start my day reading about the world leaders and their associates screaming with their actions and talking thoughtlessly. The coffee never tasted more bitter, and its my fault for starting my day this way. Anyways I quickly move on, to an ideal day where I begin working on my startup, jotting down ideas, writing about my thoughts and learnings and getting excited about the direction of the present and the expectation of the future. The music from 80s and 90s is blasting in my ear, everything seems so hopeful. Back to reality, there is a war going on, the world\u0026rsquo;s biggest economy is shooting itself in the foot and there are no subtle diplomatic thought leaders whispering sense into this world anywhere. On top of it, the blatant and ignorant propaganda that we all have been sucked into sounds too ridiculous but its their truth and may be ours, if we really want it. Probably the word I am looking for is some kind of \u0026rsquo;nuance\u0026rsquo; is lost in this world.\nMy world is filled with Intricate Technology Alright, I am not saying I have answers to all the problems I am faced with in my day to day life. I am sure anyone who is reading this hasn\u0026rsquo;t got everything figured out as well. But imagine we start blatantly telling each other fictional tales of hopeful world and taking no action to actually solve the problems bothering us. It would be bonkers to believe that we have all our wits together. But here we are! Its lunch time here in my day. The heat is getting to me ever so slightly. The food intake suffers but then the coffee supplements my chaotic day enough to keep me going through the day. I get back to work through the last stretch before I call it a day. I like to read and work on something new that happens in my world of technology. I am excited to begin working on AI Agents, try out some libraries, commercial LLMs and figure out some personal use case to implement all of it. I am researching for it and soon enough I ran into articles where the excitement faded into existential crisis. All the CEOs have on thing in common, apart from being rich, is that they like to just throw around predictions that sound absurd to general public. It makes them look visionary. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter if it actually realizes to be true. The statement is out, the press is pressed, the reader is panicked. Probably the word I am looking for is some kind of \u0026rsquo;nuance\u0026rsquo; that is lost in the tech world.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s call it a day shall we? I don\u0026rsquo;t mean to sound rude and bash the visionaries of the world. Not that they are reading this post. I believe I don\u0026rsquo;t emote in binary so I would say although I can see a world drastically different in the future, the present is a mix of hope \u0026amp; pessimism. Did that make sense? Probably not, but then the answer is somewhere in between. I am just about to end my day in the hot summer Mumbai night with some cold Ice Cream so I am chilled about the whole situation by now. I relax into my bed thinking the world will have some new crisis tomorrow morning and I am sure everyone associated with it will throw around headlines that will give us existential threat.

A popular source of my information is a platform called X or formerly known as Twitter.

The answer might not be that straightforward, if there is one.\nThe reason for this long winded rambling about the current state of chaotic information is my sheer confusion of state of affairs and utter bewilderment at the ease with which the incompetence, corruption and misinformation in the media is normalized in the world. My day starts with a scrambled mess of overpriced eggs with a loaf of bread and generic blend of coffee bought at wholesale with a tune of the latest madness around the impact of tariffs imposed by two countries with a promise of some X Billions to be added to the economy. My eggs are dry, coffee cold and the loaf of bread a hardened mess by the time I figure out the ways these geopolitical trade policies will effect me. If it is not the constant robotic feed of the social media frying my brains, there is some new Large Language Model claiming to do my job better than me. It took me 15 years to be confident about my proficiency in the job, but then an LLM can do that in 15 minutes now, on a slow day, with its one hand tied behind its back.\nThe sheer arrogance of all these events is baffling to me. The people who seem to have lost the grasp of reality are taking decisions for me and the rest of the world on our way of living and earning. All the while patting our backs in a condescending way so as as to suggest that we are in control and voted for it in all our sanity.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t have any answers to these ramblings, I think you must have guessed it by now but my reason for this post is to encourage us all keep raising questions while the madness unfolds in front of us. I am vetting my information sources while constantly questioning the motives of the decisions being taken by the world leaders.

The effect of this accelerated growth of technology on our environment and world is the hot topic of discussion. May be more relevant topic will be to discuss the changes we will have to make to our lives due to advancements in AI.\nAren\u0026rsquo;t we all annoyed at the constant jab of being replaceable by AI towards the artists, developers and other semi-essential class of workers who work hard to make a living? AI seems to be specifically aimed at replacing a very targeted group of working class folks. I for once am thrilled at all the art that AI is creating trained at the expense of the art of current artists, struggling to make a living. Replacing the customer service agent who interacts with the frustrated customers for the issues in the product that may as well be introduced by the use of AI by the development team to build the new features. The new line of iphones or horde of android phones boasting AI features that no consumer demanded yet it is shoved down the digital throats of the users. It\u0026rsquo;s as if the Tech giants decided that AI is the new frontier and we all have to accept it and adopt it at the expense of our lifestyles. My question is simple - Do we have to drastically change our life for AI or can it meet us halfway?\nProbably, there is a better use case somewhere out there in the world for AI to make our lives better, our existing life without having to change every facet of it. Are the AI makers going to take that route? Definitely, no. If we have learned anything at all from the big internet boom of early 2000s is that the big tech corporations will always find a way to exploit the average population at the expense of their physical and mental health to a point where an entire generation is dependent on the big tech software for trivial decision making of their non-trivial lives. May be, the idea to write this article was also influenced by an ad I saw on Instagram which was fed to me as a result of my internet activity on my phone and other apps like X. Do you recognize this seed of doubt in your own ideas and work? This is what the new age combination of AI and Internet manages to do to our thinking.\nI know, all this seems like a very long winded way of saying AI is bad, big tech is bad, should we go live in the woods? Let me assure you it is more than that. I have been working in the tech industry for 15 years. I have seen most of it, the way it evolves, worked on solutions and then seen them become invalid in the tests of time. There is only one thing that matters and it has always been the case, Evolution. The age old answer to our existence. The evolution of us as beings from being barbaric survivalists to sophisticated innovators and explorers of space, its all a result of being independent and free thinkers with an ability to acquire and master real world skills. AI in its current form can barely scratch the earth\u0026rsquo;s surface to uncover resources required to help us make a living. But if you have followed the big tech news, you would think AI is at forefront of everything and we might as well pack up and go back to living in the woods.\nI am not just criticizing like an average internal rambler for the sake of it. I want to present with solutions or at least try to understand a way to share a common ground as a veteran tech enthusiast between old tech and new age AI tech world. I appreciate the use of LLM in my day to day work. As a Data Engineer \u0026amp; Analyst running a consultancy, having a LLM on my machine is like having a sparring partner for everyday work. Am I going to replace a team of Data Engineers with bunch of AI Agents, short answer no. I might encourage running the solutions through the models for any issues before deploying it on production. For my hobbies and passions, I am a classic rock kind of guy so I don\u0026rsquo;t even appreciate the auto-tuned mess that is modern music, so I will never replace my Led Zeppelin and classic rock collection with slop made by AI. Similarly, there is no replacement for a thought fully created masterpiece like Lord of the rings, the book and the movie, that makes original thought and writing of a visionary more accessible to a avid movie goer and a reader. I might use AI to make some marketing content for my consultancy business but then I am not going to pretend that the movies made by AI are in same realm as the average movie made by artists.\nI think we are all looking for some perspective and expectation management in our day to day lives when it comes to using technology. I don\u0026rsquo;t want AI to summarize my emails and texts to me or constantly try to guess my words I am texting or suggest places to visit or eat out. If I have learnt anything from the scandals of data mining from tech companies is that they want to tap into the thoughts and minds of people just to drown the masses in consumerism. We have wholeheartedly allowed them to do so, at the expense of our individualism or the very essence that makes us humans. I am a tech enthusiast and I want to co-exist with the technology and not constantly have it replace all my interests and hobbies, dare I say my friends \u0026amp; life.
