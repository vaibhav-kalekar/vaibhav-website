The times are highly complicated and the people dealing with the complications seem to be well versed with heightening the complication rather than dissolving it. But I don’t want to talk about the world problems. I am no one to solve them. I am just a techie trying not to get replaced by AI agents or robots or whoever else whats to take my job from me. I will probably end up working on the team that creates those very AI agents that will do my job, so there is a sense of nobility of working hard in there somewhere.\nThe optimism in the pessimistic times It is a hot summer morning here in Mumbai. I am spending my summer here at home in Mumbai after a long time. Also in a very long time, I am working on building something I am really passionate about, so it is quite a remarkable time for me. I am excited but also somewhat shocked reading about the events of the world. I start my day reading about the world leaders and their associates screaming with their actions and talking thoughtlessly. The coffee never tasted more bitter, and its my fault for starting my day this way. Anyways I quickly move on, to an ideal day where I begin working on my startup, jotting down ideas, writing about my thoughts and learnings and getting excited about the direction of the present and the expectation of the future. The music from 80s and 90s is blasting in my ear, everything seems so hopeful. Back to reality, there is a war going on, the world’s biggest economy is shooting itself in the foot and there are no subtle diplomatic thought leaders whispering sense into this world anywhere. On top of it, the blatant and ignorant propaganda that we all have been sucked into sounds too ridiculous but its their truth and may be ours, if we really want it. Probably the word I am looking for is some kind of ’nuance’ is lost in this world.\nMy world is filled with Intricate Technology Alright, I am not saying I have answers to all the problems I am faced with in my day to day life. I am sure anyone who is reading this hasn’t got everything figured out as well. But imagine we start blatantly telling each other fictional tales of hopeful world and taking no action to actually solve the problems bothering us. It would be bonkers to believe that we have all our wits together. But here we are! Its lunch time here in my day. The heat is getting to me ever so slightly. The food intake suffers but then the coffee supplements my chaotic day enough to keep me going through the day. I get back to work through the last stretch before I call it a day. I like to read and work on something new that happens in my world of technology. I am excited to begin working on AI Agents, try out some libraries, commercial LLMs and figure out some personal use case to implement all of it. I am researching for it and soon enough I ran into articles where the excitement faded into existential crisis. All the CEOs have on thing in common, apart from being rich, is that they like to just throw around predictions that sound absurd to general public. It makes them look visionary. It doesn’t matter if it actually realizes to be true. The statement is out, the press is pressed, the reader is panicked. Probably the word I am looking for is some kind of ’nuance’ that is lost in the tech world.\nLet’s call it a day shall we? I don’t mean to sound rude and bash the visionaries of the world. Not that they are reading this post. I believe I don’t emote in binary so I would say although I can see a world drastically different in the future, the present is a mix of hope \u0026 pessimism. Did that make sense? Probably not, but then the answer is somewhere in between. I am just about to end my day in the hot summer Mumbai night with some cold Ice Cream so I am chilled about the whole situation by now. I relax into my bed thinking the world will have some new crisis tomorrow morning and I am sure everyone associated with it will throw around headlines that will give us existential threat. Why worry eh! The world we live in is so devoid of Nuance, it is gaslighting each other.
