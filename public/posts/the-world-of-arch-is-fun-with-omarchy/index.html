I am trying to understand the Aussie way of living while holding onto the quiet traumas of spending three years in Germany. It is all an overload of emotion while managing two states of life. Sydney is a beautiful city. The induction into a new country and a busy city like Sydney has been seamless, a lot of it thanks to my partner and some of it thanks to the system. On a personal level, I tend to find my solace in simple things that are familiar to me, my system, and my writing. Here I am, while I wait for the new chapter to begin in full swing, exploring the familiar world of Technology and sharing my experience with you all in writing.\nBroken Framework revived with Arch \u0026 Omarchy I run a small Data Consultancy firm for startups and small businesses to make sense of their Data Strategy \u0026 Architecture. You can read more about it here - Etherion Consulting. Being a Data Engineer \u0026 Architect, I preferred to get a Linux-based laptop called Framework 13 with AMD Ryzen 7 and loaded it with Ubuntu for daily work. Everything worked fine until I had to travel with it, and in the process, the motherboard died on me. Looking to set up a business and having no way to quickly fix the issue at hand, I decided to go back to my trusted MacBook Pro. Fast Forward, now in Sydney, having revived the Framework laptop and installed Arch Linux, I came across the growing sensation on the internet called Omarchy. I had to wget it. I was not ready for the pleasant surprise that would come with it.\nMacOS is Amazing, Linux is Personal A little bit of context behind this tug of war between macOS and Linux. I have been a happy Windows user throughout the early days of my career, while lately I have enjoyed using macOS for work and personal use. The MacBooks are wonderful devices with very little to complain about, other than the cost of these wonderful machines. So imagine my surprise when I had the chance to buy a new device for my business, MacBooks weren’t the obvious choice I had leaned towards for purchase. I went back to the old school way of making a purchasing decision, researching to my heart’s content and narrowing the options that agreed with my preferences. It’s crazy, I know, why not just get the latest and greatest, right? I had made my choice, and after much back and forth with my girlfriend, I leaped.\nBringing back the enthusiasm for Technology It is time-consuming to sift through hordes of processors and chip combinations to find with best performance and battery combinations to finally narrow down an aesthetically pleasing device that I would like to pick up for use every day. It is also satisfying to know that the device in hand is something I chose piece by piece to my liking. A connection I tend to lack with the ready-to-use MacBooks, Surface, and other Windows devices. As someone who started their career in the early 2000s, I enjoyed the process of building PCs and researching new devices, which was lost over time. Now, at a stage where I can afford to make purchases without researching the devices, I have lost the enthusiasm for them. Building the Framework Laptop and loading Linux with something like Omarchy gave me the feeling of owning a personal computer as really personal.\nTug of War and the Winners Anyone who has been in the world of Software or Hardware knows that there is always something newer and shinier that catches our eyes. Thus, it is never a choice made for the long term, but a choice resonating from an ethos. Am I a MacBook or a Linux guy? Do I like to build stuff or own shiny things? Do I enjoy my work, or do I only care about the growth and revenue? As a business owner looking to build data engineering solutions for clients, I need to pick a lane. You know what, I might be on the cusp of going full throttle with one such lane.\nThe Analog Perspective - Please Join!
