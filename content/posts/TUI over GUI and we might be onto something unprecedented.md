Every generation has its kryptonite that spirals most of them into anxiety-laden, desperate attempts to hold onto their belongings. The skills acquired through incessant toiling and spending of borrowed currencies suddenly cease to be valid in the world. What next?
The folks of the 80s and 90s dealt with the onset of computerization of the common skilled jobs and the dot-com boom, respectively. Some came out at the business end of it with new skills, while some managed to hold onto their steady lives. The point is, we survive and thrive at the onset of every adversity. The latest one is just another chance to spin up some new inventions.

I like technology. Every new piece of technology intrigues me and that makes me an early adopter of tech. You can argue that it is part of my job as a Software Engineer. Hence LLMs or AI as it is called in layman terms were part of my life before it became commercial.

The way I look at it, I can summarize the hyper and struggles for some of us with AI in few bullet points - 

 - AI is here to stay and we might as well get comfortable with it.
 - AI is getting rid of excuses for us.
 - AI is supplement to our daily dose of tech nutrition. We need it while consume it with caution.

I know these bullet points might sound a bit vague but allow me to explain it in a longer post.
