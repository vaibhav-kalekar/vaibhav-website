Graphical User Interfaces, or GUI, the shiny, most coveted area of the internet and software in general, is always the face of innovation. Some might say that progress is always defined by the visible aspects of the software. Take an example of the latest innovation, like AI, there was almost no noise when it was used as an LLM in a terminal by some academics, data scientists, and developers, quietly prompting away at the terminal or hacking their way through APIs to train the models that underfit or overfit the expected output, depending on the data. Generate some funny responses and images, and suddenly it's the new frontier of modern software engineering.
Take the UI away, what do we have? And how should we make the world care about the advancements in software and/or hardware?

The way I look at it, TUIs need a bit more clarity to be part of the mainstream. In my post I cover - 

 - What is TUI?
 - Why do we need TUIs? 
 - Updates can be easily pushed across
 - Examples of widely used TUIs

I know these bullet points might sound a bit vague but allow me to explain it in a longer post.
