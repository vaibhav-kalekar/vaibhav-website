# Episode 2

The mornings are never pleasant for Eon. The world around him is chaotic, yet hardworking and honest. People on the chain get busy early in the morning to catch the worm, so to speak. The jobs range from trivial to extremely sensitive depending on the time of the day. Every small job matters on the chain, as it is a matter of livelihood for some and pride for others.

Eon woke up in a furor over the events that transpired yesterday. Up until now he has gone way out of his way to make sure he is living in a incognito mode. He didn't appreciate being dragged into the whole ruckus surrounding the kid. There are scars from the past and memories that still haunt Eon and he had no inclination to reopen them for anybody's sake. One look at the condition of the boy might change his mind, it is exactly what he was trying to avoid.

## The past and the future with unpleasant present

Xer woke up from his slumber with Eon staring at a device in his hands. He is not new to the running around and evading goons or law enforcement professionals but this is something entirely out of his range of skillset. All Xer wanted to do was find something to trade in the thrift store for his comfort, probably for a day or two. Xer looked at Eon and he knew something was not right and in all the serious expressions on his face, Xer realized that something was about to go very wrong. He looked around the place they were holed up in.

The light seeped through a small window that felt more like a skylight. The entire layout felt more like a container or a blob floating on something or held together by strings. A hatch that opened outwards while the entire room was barely enough for two people to stretch. It seemed to be designed with specific purpose in mind, and with the look on the face of Eon it was serving its purpose, may be not for long. The container seemed to be made up of materials that might be used to make submarine. The space between hard shell and Xer was separated by sort of foam that provided comfort. You can barely stand and the hexagonal shape made no excuse to have a corner in the container. There were supplies may be for a week if you don't plan to eat much while you are there. A system that was offline and the entire place seem to block any kind of wireless communication trying to connect with the device. Only source of connection was a small port that was connected to some network on the outside. Xer tried to peep through the window but all he could see was the morning sky and some wires dangling between him and the sky, probably holding the container together in place where he is currently seated.

Eon repeated the question he had asked in his apartment the day before - "Where did you get this device and Why are you carrying with you?"

Xer didn't break his gaze away from the window. He wanted to ignore Eon and concentrate on not panicking while in this confined space. He never did well under duress and more so in such a confined space. He tapped on the window again.

Eon seemed irritated and threw a protein bar at Xer in a way to get his attention. He partially succeeded in irritating Xer but not exactly grabbing his attention. Eon tried again.

"The device you hold is important but dangerous, it has comprised not just you but dragged me in with you as well. It cannot be destroyed and once the authorities got to know that it is out there somewhere, they will do anything to get it back. So I ask again, Why and How did you get it? Do you know what it is?"

Xer was intrigued. "Is it worth a lot?"

"Its worth more than you and me for those who seek it, and they will have no qualms in killing us for it. So for fuck sake , answer my question." Eon's hoarse voice echoed.

"I found this in the landfill, I told you before. I did not know what it is but I know it looked special. The men at the thrift store were interested but then they tried to force it from me. That is all. Now tell me what it is? and give it back to me, its mine." Xer tried to get some authority back.

Eon looked at him for a while, looked at the device connected to his mini system like a tablet or a laptop, stared at the screen in front of him for a while, so as to seem like he was stuck in a conundrum in his mind. It was few minutes before he spoke with a decisive tone.

"The device is from the year 2025. It was launched by the administration as a way to distribute new form of currency, a token if you will for those who worked for the administration and carried out specific functions. The device was means to collect compensation or salary and use it to spend it on essentials. It was considered a previliged way to hold the currency and only worked within administration approved regions. It was discontinued when the device was used to illegally distribute the token which the administration had no way to control. It was replaced by another device and then another until today where the entire ecosystem of tokens or currency is attached to a individual's identity scanned with biometrics only." Eon explained it generously and continued.

"What you found is a device which has tokens still active yet it is not tracked by the system in any way until I plugged it into the network with my system. It exposed the device, my system, me and my associated you as well. Hence the authorities on our tail and probably we will end of dead if we don't figure out a way to deal with it in a more effective way."

Xer liked the explanation of the device as it meant it is of tremendous value and a big pay day to make him comfortable for near future. He was no stranger to some jeopardy and was brought up on the chain by parents who struggled enough for him to learn to carry his own weight as soon as he was able to run around.
