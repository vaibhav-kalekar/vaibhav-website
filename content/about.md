Iâ€™m Vaibhav Kalekar, Co-Founder of Etherion Consulting & writer of the publication title "The Analog Perspective".

Throughout my 20 years of career in Tech, I have worked across the entire spectrum of software engineering.
My learnings range from domain level expertise to technical deep dive on product engineering and data engineering. I want to use my little space on internet to share my about my experiences and learnings.

As Co-Founder and Data Engineering Consultant at Etherion Consulting, I am involved with multiple organizations looking to revamp their Data Migration, Integration and Governance Strategies. My philosophy while working with clients is always to maximise short term gains while looking at long term benefits. You can connect with me to know more about it.

Apart from Data Engineering, I am an avid photographer, traveller and writer.
In my publication I share about my photography, travel stories and snippets of my creative fiction writing in the sci-fi, dystopian genre.

I appreciate the finer moments in this chaotic world and like to capture them with my Fujifilm X-E4 camera and Fujinon 18-55mm lens.

I have lived in Mumbai, Chicago & Munich, and I am currently transitioning to a new home. I have travelled extensively across USA, Europe and India.
