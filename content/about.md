I’m Vaibhav Kalekar, Co-Founder of Etherion Consulting & writer of this publication.

I am a lifelong tech enthusiast who continues to be privileged to work on everything related to technology and data. I have been here for around 15 years in my 30+ years on earth. This puts me in a unique position to write about “the good, the not-so-good, and the worst part” of the tech industry.

I appreciate the finer moments in this chaotic world and like to capture them with my Fujifilm X-E4 camera and Fujinon 18-55mm lens.

I have lived in Mumbai and Chicago, and I am currently working in Munich.
