Have you ever gone on a vacation to a place where you are not aware of the happenings and history of the place? Your intentions of booking the trip were vastly different than the actual vacation, yet you wonder Why was I so off about the vibe of this place?
That is exactly how I felt about Budapest from the minute I set foot on the streets out of the station. My expectation from the place was to spend some quiet time enjoying the food and drinks in the city. I ended up immersing myself in the city's vibe.
I enjoyed every moment of it.

Budapest is renowned for its rich historical significance. The Danube River that separates the two cities, Buda & Pest, is at the center of the stories from the world war era. The more I wandered along the banks of the river attached to the historic Parliament house, I was in awe of the architecture.
The perfect blend of Modern mixed with restored Historical features.

I planned to spend my days working while exploring the city like a local. The morning walk along the city center to pick up coffee turned it a gazing affair between the quaint narrow lanes of the city and my camera.
It made my day even before the hustle and bustle of a workday got me busy.

The evenings were spent wandering the city for some pictures that I could capture while experimenting with my camera.
Oh! The city lights up well, and people are in good spirits to end their day, no matter how hectic. I know mine was pretty busy one, and the walks along the cityscape calmed my mind and my soul.

When people say unplanned travels are the best, they are truly not lying. I wanted to have a change of scenery while my busy schedule consumes me, and I ended up being thoroughly immersed in the charm of Budapest.
Budapest - 10/10 highly recommend.
