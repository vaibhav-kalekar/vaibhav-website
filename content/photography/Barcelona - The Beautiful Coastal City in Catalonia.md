Today, I am revisiting one of the most beautiful European places I have ever visited. I know there are a lot of cities and towns with unique quirks about them, but none that I came across like Barcelona, with the big city vibe masked by a feel of a small town with rich cultural heritage and tradition.
From the Gothic Quarter in the city center of Barcelona to Park Güell and the Picasso Museum, the city celebrates history.
Ask the street musician playing Harp, he might have some verses.

Walk down the Gothic quarters to the old town, and the sights of street musicians change to those of small-time art galleries. If not for the Tintin memorabilia hanging at the front door of the store, I would stop for some Bowie, any time of the day.
It’s tough being a Hero, a healthy portion of Paella by the beach, and an afternoon siesta helps.
It is a tradition in Catalonia.

A little way down the road, the evenings in Barcelona go well into the midnight. The sunset hue is mesmerising. Enjoy it with a bit of coffee and croquettes, but leave enough room for a drink and olive oil-infused dinners.

Get ready to walk a lot. I mean a lot. Ever wondered if you could experience a zoomed-in view of one of the wonders of the world?
On my way from Park Güell, I got a zoomed-out view of the beautiful Basílica de la Sagrada Família.
It was in that moment, I decided to have a look at the inside, and I was not disappointed.
The spiritual experience is not in the belief but in the moment of emotional revelation.

The interiors of the Basílica de la Sagrada Família are a spiritual experience of their own. The reflection of sunrays from the colorful glass panes of the interior columns of the church cut right through any preoccupied thoughts in the mind. It immediately transported me to some deep reflections and made me forget my immediate surroundings.
Gaudí seemed obsessed with Gothic architecture, and it surely reflected in all his works. Even the supposedly unfinished Basilica.
I made sure the experience at the Basilica was the last one for the day, giving myself enough time to reflect on its marvel throughout the evening.
