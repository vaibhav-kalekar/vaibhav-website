After moving from one beloved city I called home to a completely new one that became a second home, and then leaving that to move and settle into an entirely unknown city can take its toll.
I am fortunate enough to call some of the most beautiful cities in the world as my home - Mumbai to Chicago to Munich and now Sydney.

I am learning the ways of Sydney and Australia, yet it has been such a smooth transition to be swayed by the charm of this beautiful city.
